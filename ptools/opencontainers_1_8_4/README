What Am I?:

OpenContainers (aka OC) is an open C++ containers library, similar to
the C++ Standard Template Library (aka the C++ STL or STL) or Boost
library. OpenContainers addresses threading issues (see below) that
the STL has not addressed (until very recently: C++0x added support
for threads[1]). The OC also has tools to make the C++ environment
feel more like Python (much like some of the tools in the Boost
libraries).
