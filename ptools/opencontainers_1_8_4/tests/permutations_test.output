** Hard Test:  compare two permutation generators ** 
Permutations of length 0
Permutations of length 1
Permutations of length 2
Permutations of length 3
Permutations of length 4
Permutations of length 5
Permutations of length 6
Permutations of length 7
 ** Seed Simple test first:  Try the first six, as well 
** as a few after (to see if if returns round).
