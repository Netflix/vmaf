** modifications **

(12/19/2016 zli@netflix.com) Three modifications are made to fit into the VDK framework:
1) Instead of specifying number of seconds to read, read file until the end.
2) Instead of calculating a frame score every two frames, change it to one score
every frame.
3) Original algorithm averages frame SRRED and TRRED scores first, and the final
STRRED score is the product of the two. In this modified version, only the per-
frame SRRED and TRRED scores are calculated and passed out. The computation of
the STRRED score is performed outside, by first computing the per-frame STRRED
score via:
per-frame STRRED = (per-frame SRRED) * (per-frame TRRED)
and then aggregating (e.g. via taking the mean).

** run **

Command run_strred takes in arguments:
ref_yuv_file_path dis_yuv_file_path width height

After installing Matlab and setting path, run STRRED in command line:
matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop -r "run_strred('../../python/test/resource/yuv/src01_hrc00_576x324.yuv', '../../python/test/resource/yuv/src01_hrc01_576x324.yuv', 576, 324); exit;"
